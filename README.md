  ## Description

  This project was created to create simple logos using inquirer, node js, and jest. With this tool, I can easily create a .svg file that creates a shape with text of the user's choice.


  ## Installation

  Clone this repository and open in VS Code. Then, install Node.JS Version 16.18.1, Jest Version 29.4.3, and Inquirer.js: Version 8.2.4.


  ## Usage

  To use this app, the user must go into the terminal and install inquirer fs and jest. Once that is done, they will enter "node index.js" to answer the prompted questions. Once that is complete, they will have their customized logo in a new file, generated-logo.svg.

  ## Tests

  I tested this project by running and previewing it, as I have put above. I also created a test file specifically for that use, so that when I run npm test, jest runs a series of tests that either pass or fail.
